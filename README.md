# Siesmic_Bumps

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a seismic event will result in a hazardous seismic bump in a coal mine based on a set of features extracted from seismic recordings. The model should be able to help mine operators quickly identify hazardous situations and take appropriate safety measures to prevent accidents.

To accomplish this, we will explore the Seismic Bumps dataset and perform data analysis to understand the relationships between the different features and the target variable (hazardous or not). We will preprocess the data, including handling missing values, scaling the features, and addressing class imbalance. We will then experiment with different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and boosting, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

A machine learning model to classify hazardous seismic events in the Seismic Bumps dataset. The model utilized the Naive Bayes Algorithm with SMOTE oversampling technique and achieved a accuracy of 74.8% and recall of 84.8% for the hazardous class.

The developed model provides a valuable tool for identifying and predicting hazardous seismic events, which can contribute to improving safety and response measures in areas affected by seismic activity.
